# Background
This manuscript describes options for analyzing trends in DCCO populations in the San Francisco Bay Area from 1985--2017.

# Methods
Following the methods of Manuwal et al (2000), I plotted raw regional counts using loess and standard error shading. I identified which regions followed exponential growth and which followed logistic growth by visualizing the ln-transformed regional counts. For the regions of the Bridges and South Farallone Islands, I identified subsets of years where data followed distinct trajectories and fit independent linear models for each data subset. I fit logistic growth equations for the regions of the North Bay, Outer Coast, and South Bay.
