# Background
This manuscript describes options for analyzing trends in DCCO populations in the San Francisco Bay Area from 1985--2017.

#Methods
##General Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs)
Count data are frequently used to estimate population trends, but are subject to biases in data collection. Notably, raw counts are strongly affected by survey effort and survey dates and long-term trends can be biased by short-term annual shifts due to environmental variation. Our raw counts are likey subject to these effects. The North Bay and South Bay regions contain multiple (12+) DCCO nesting colonies, but not all sites were visited in each year and more sites were visited in the later years compared to the early years of the study. Site occupation also depends on day of the season. Birds arrive to breed in April, peak breeding occurs in June, and they depart in August. Nest counts increase and then decrease as the season progresses, so day of the season is an important covariate when inferring colony size. Other potential covariates are survey type (aerial, boat, or ground) and the observing organization. To account for potential biases, we included notable covariates in our estimates of regional trends. Long-term population dynamics are frequently non-linear, so we used an approach that would allow for nonlinear trends.

General additive mixed models are superior to using exponential and logistic growth equations because it is possible to include an interaction term between colony and year, which allows each colony to growth nonlinearly over time. Estimating the regional counts by summing colony counts and weighting those counts by estimated error corrects for years when certain colonies were not visited. This method also allows for additive terms to inform colony size, so I was able to test the effect of count date and survey type on colony counts. Both these covariates were likely to confound our estimates of regional population size.

Methods follow those of Shadish et al. 2014. GAMMs were devoped using the gam function in R. The model took the following form:

count ~ year*colony + day + survey type

I modeled regional counts by assuming that the regional count in a given year is equal to the sum of the estimated colony counts. The estimated colony counts were weighted by colony size (relative to the overall regional size) and the standard error of the estimate, such that:

E(x) = sum(p * c / r / s)

where E(x) is the estimated regional count in year x, the sum occurs across all colonies in that region, p is the estimated colony count in year x, c is the mean estimated colony count across all years, r is the mean regional count across all years, and s is the standard error of the estimated colony count in year x.

Fig `r figure.num`. Effect of count date (ie day of the year) illustrated using predicted trend values for a standardized site, year, and survey type. This plot illustrates that counts later in the season are more similar to the latent colony size than counts earlier in the season (among the range of count dates included in this study). For a given nest count, counting on day 200 compared to day 100 leads to a `r round((subset(counts.day, day==200)$pred-subset(counts.day, day==100)$pred)/(subset(counts.day, day==200)$pred+subset(counts.day, day==100)$pred)*100, 2)`% difference in the magnitude of the colony trend estimate.

Fig `r figure.num`. Effect of survey type illustreated using the predicted trend value for a standard site, year, and day with standard error bars. This plot illustrates that survey types lead to differences in counts. This plot implies that Ground counts are most representative of latent colony sizes, followed by aerial, boat, and combination boat/ground counts. Therefore, Boat/Ground, Boat, and Aerial surveys underestimate latent colony sizes to a greater degree than Ground surveys. Aerial surveys that report a given colony count (e.g. 200 nests) result in trend estimates that are `r round((subset(counts.type, Survey.type=="Aerial")$pred-subset(counts.type, Survey.type=="Ground")$pred)/(subset(counts.type, Survey.type=="Aerial")$pred+subset(counts.type, Survey.type=="Ground")$pred)*100, 2)`% larger than a Ground survey reporting the same colony count.
